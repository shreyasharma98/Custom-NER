Thursday B-tim
that O
what O

is O
not O
a O

to O

announce O
a O

The O
newspaper O

the O

In O
an O
article O
published O
Sunday B-tim
in O
the O
journal O
Nature O
researchers O
said O
people O
with O
a O
variation O
of O
the O
gene O
are O
as O
much O
as O
50 O
percent O
more O
likely O
to O
suffer O
from O
type O
1 O
diabetes O

That O
sort O
of O
diabetes O
is O
also O
called O
juvenile O
diabetes O
because O
it O
is O
often O
diagnosed O
in O
childhood O
or O
early O
adulthood O

Researchers O
say O
the O
ability O
to O
forecast O
a O
vulnerability O
to O
diabetes O
would O
allow O
doctors O
to O
intervene O
in O
time O
to O
lessen O
its O
impact O
on O
patients O

Type O
1 O
diabetes O
is O
an O
incurable O
disease O
in O

the O

each O
loved O
him O
very O
much O

desired O

see O
him O
like O
herself O

Now O
the O
Man O

hair O
was O
turning O
grey O

the O
young O

did O
not O

it O
made O
him O
look O
too O
old O

every O

comb O

out O

the O

saw O
her O

growing O
grey O

great O
pleasure O
for O
she O
did O
not O
like O

be O
mistaken O
for O
his O
mother O

So O
every O
morning O
she O

arrange O

pick O
out O

many O

However O
Mr. B-per
Mahathir I-per

objected O

Iran B-geo
insists O
it O

not O

the O

's O
centrist O
Kadima B-per
Party I-per
and O
the O
Dovish B-org
Labor I-org
party O
have O
signed O
a O
coalition O
agreement O

It O
includes O
a O
pledge O
to O
withdraw O
from O
large O
parts O
of O
the O
West B-org
Bank I-org
over O
the O
next O
four B-tim
years O

Under O
Mr. B-per
Olmert I-per
's O
plan O
about O
70,000 O
Jewish O
settlers O
would O
be O
removed O
from O
their O
homes O

At O
the O
same O
time O
Israel B-geo
would O
annex O
big O
West B-org
Bank I-org
settlement O
blocs O

Mr. B-per
Olmert I-per
says O
he O
would O
prefer O
to O
do O
this O
as O
part O
of O
an O
agreement O
with O
the O
Palestinians B-gpe

But O
he O
believes O
that O
is O
impossible O
because O
the O
Islamic B-org
militant I-org
group I-org
Hamas I-org
which O
seeks O
Israel B-geo
's O
destruction O
now O
heads O
the O
Palestinian B-gpe
Authority O

Mr. B-per
Olmert I-per
says O
if O
there O
is O
no O
Palestinian B-gpe
peace O
partner O
Israel B-geo
will O
withdraw O
unilaterally O

We O
will O
have O
to O
act O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
broad O
national O
consensus O
in O
Israel B-geo
and O
work O
towards O
fixing O
of O
the O
permanent O
border O
lines O
even O
without O
an O

Former O
Palestinian B-gpe

Sabri B-per
Saddam I-per
says O
expanding O
settlements O
and O
annexing O
land O
will O
only O
bring O
more O
conflict O

The O
unilateral O
withdrawal O
is O
not O
a O
solution O
at O
all O
but O
rather O
a O
FALSE O
disengagement O
he O
said O

What O
we O
're O
looking O
for O
is O
a O
final O
just O
and O
fair O
peace O

In O
addition O
to O
Palestinian B-gpe
opposition O
Mr. B-per
Olmert I-per
faces O
another O
obstacle O
to O
implementing O
the O
pullout O
plan O

His O
coalition O
with O
Labor B-org
does O
not O
give O
him O
a O
majority O
in O
the O
120-member O
Knesset O
or O
parliament O

Therefore O
he O
will O
have O
to O
bring O
the O
ultra-Orthodox O
Shas O
party O
into O
the O
coalition O
and O
Shas B-org
opposes O
the O
pullout O
plan O

Analysts O
say O
the O

collapse O

A O
Farmer B-tim
one I-tim
day I-tim
came O
to O
the O
stables O
to O
see O
to O
his O
beasts O
of O
burden O
: O
among O
them O
was O
his O
favourite O
Ass O
that O
was O
always O
well O
fed O
and O
often O
carried O
his O
master O

With O
the O
Farmer B-tim
came O
his O
Lapdog B-tim
who O
danced O
about O
and O
licked O
his O
hand O
and O
frisked O
about O
as O
happy O
as O
could O
be O

The O
Farmer B-tim
felt O
in O
his O
pocket O
gave O
the O
Lapdog B-tim
some O
dainty O
food O
and O
sat O
down O
while O
he O
gave O
his O
orders O
to O
his O
servants O

The O
Lapdog B-tim
jumped O
into O
his O
master O
's O
lap O
and O
lay O
there O
blinking O
while O
the O
Farmer B-tim
stroked O
his O
ears O

The O
Ass O
seeing O
this O
broke O
loose O
from O
his O
halter O
and O
commenced O
prancing O
about O
in O
imitation O
of O
the O
Lapdog B-tim

The O
Farmer O
could O
not O
hold O
his O
sides O
with O
laughter O
so O
the O
Ass O
went O
up O
to O
him O
and O
putting O
his O
feet O
upon O
the O
Farmer B-tim
's O
shoulder O
attempted O
to O
climb O
into O
his O
lap O

The O
Farmer O
's O
servants O
rushed O
up O
with O
sticks O
and O
pitchforks O
and O
soon O
taught O
the O
Ass O
that O
Clumsy O
jesting O
is O
no O
joke O

A O
Man O
came O
into O
a O
Wood B-tim
one I-tim
day I-tim
with O
an O
axe O
in O
his O
hand O
and O
begged O
all O
the O
Trees O
to O
give O
him O
a O
small O
branch O
which O
he O
wanted O
for O
a O
particular O
purpose O

The O
Trees O
were O
good-natured O
and O
gave O
him O
one O
of O
their O
branches O

What O
did O
the O
Man O
do O
but O
fix O
it O
into O
the O
axe O
head O
and O
soon O
set O
to O
work O
cutting O
down O
tree O
after O
tree O

Then O
the O
Trees O
saw O
how O
foolish O
they O
had O
been O
in O
giving O
their O
enemy O
the O
means O
of O
destroying O
themselves O

AN O
ASS O
feeding O
in O
a O
meadow O
saw O
a O
Wolf B-org
approaching O
to O
seize O
him O
and O
immediately O
pretended O
to O
be O
lame O

The O
Wolf B-org
coming O
up O
inquired O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
lameness O

The O
Ass O
replied O
that O
passing O
through O
a O
hedge O
he O
had O
trod O
with O
his O
foot O
upon O
a O
sharp O
thorn O

He O
requested O
that O
the O
Wolf B-org
pull O
it O
out O
lest O
when O
he O
ate O
him O
it O
should O
injure O
his O
throat O

The O
Wolf B-org
consented O
and O
lifted O
up O
the O
foot O
and O
was O
giving O
his O
whole O
mind O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
thorn O
when O
the O
Ass O
with O
his O
heels O
kicked B-Crime
his O
teeth O
into O
his O
mouth O
and O
galloped O
away O

The O
Wolf B-org
being O
thus O
fearfully O
mauled O
said O
I O
am O
rightly O
served O
for O
why O
did O
I O
attempt O
the O
art O
of O
healing O

my O

A O
FOX O
invited O

nothing O

some O

fell O
out O

at O
every O
mouthful O

his O

at O
not O

afforded O
the O
Fox B-org
much O
amusement O

The O
Crane O
in O
his O
turn O
asked O
the O
Fox O
to O
sup O

him O

set O
before O
her O
a O
